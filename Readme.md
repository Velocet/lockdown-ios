Lockd0wn is an Open Source and free firewall for your iOS device. This project is a frok of the original [https://github.com/confirmedcode/lockdown-ios](Lockdown) without the VPN service and built-in [https://www.appconfig.org/](AppConfig) functionality. As this app should protect users it does not contain any telemetry or tracking.
